  <b><h3>Education Background:</h3> </b>I was born in Punjab, India. I did my schooling at [<b>Dayanand Model School</b>](http://dmsjalandhar.org/) Jalandhar and completed my undergraduate degree(Engineering) in the field of Electronics and Communication from [<b>National Institute of Technology</b>](https://www.nitj.ac.in/) Jalandhar in 2018. Being a big fan of art and a technical whiz, I've decided to combine the two and work as an analyst and visualization developer. I flew to Toronto to do my post graduation at [<b>St. Clair College</b>](https://www.stclaircollege.ca/), Windsor. I am currently in my final semester, which will end in April & look forward to get an exposure in the Canadian work environment.
  
  <b><h3>Employement History:</h3></b> During my final year of Engineering, I got campus placement with [Reliance Industries Ltd.](https://www.ril.com/)
