  <b><h3>Education Background:</h3> </b>I was born in Punjab, India. I did my schooling at [<b>Dayanand Model School</b>](http://dmsjalandhar.org/) Jalandhar and completed my undergraduate degree in the field of Electronics and Communication Engineeri from [<b>National Institute of Technology</b>](https://www.nitj.ac.in/) Jalandhar in 2018. Being a big fan of art and a technical whiz, I've decided to combine the two and work as an analyst and visualization developer. I flew to Toronto to do my post graduation at [<b>St. Clair College</b>](https://www.stclaircollege.ca/), Windsor. I am currently in my final semester, which will end in April & look forward to get an exposure in the Canadian work environment.
  
  <b><h3>Employment History:</h3></b> I got a campus placement with one of the Fortune 500 companies during my final year of Engineering. I accepted a position as a Junior Engineer - Visualization with [<b>Reliance Industries Ltd.</b>](https://www.ril.com/) in Mumbai. I learned numerous platforms by working in different teams and areas and in 2020 bid farewell to all of my wonderful colleagues to pursue my post graduation in the field of Data Analytics for Business.
  
  <b><h3>Interests:</h3></b> I am a hardcore foodie and an [<b>artist</b>](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AougaZb5lveAgi8HG2-7WQoVbu_X?e=xRYNdt).  My weekends are spent with my canvas and paints, decorating the walls of my home and painting anything in sight. Whatever the object is, whether it's a T-shirt, jeans, antiquities, or shoes, I make it vibrant. This my my path of combining my creative   interest with a career as an analyst where I would be able to create different insightful, attractive dashboards.
